Step 1: Define Requirements

- Clearly define the requirements and goals of your application. Understand what features you want to implement, the data you need from MLB The Show, and how you want to display and interact with that data.

Step 2: Set Up Laravel

- Install Laravel 10 and set up your development environment.
- Configure your database connection in the Laravel configuration files to connect to your PHPMyAdmin database.

Step 3: Create Database Schema

- Design your database schema to store the MLB The Show data. Define the necessary tables and their relationships.
- Use Laravel's migration feature to create the database schema and run the migrations to set up the database.

Step 4: Fetch MLB The Show Data

- Write PHP scripts or Laravel commands to fetch data from MLB The Show game.
- Store the fetched data in your PHPMyAdmin database using Laravel's Eloquent ORM or raw SQL queries.

Step 5: Design API Endpoints

- Design the API endpoints in Laravel that will expose the MLB The Show data to your Next.js frontend.
- Decide on the necessary API routes, such as retrieving player stats, team information, game scores, etc.

Step 6: Implement API Endpoints

- Implement the API endpoints in Laravel according to the designs from the previous step.
- Utilize Laravel's routing system and controllers to handle the API requests and return the appropriate responses.

Step 7: Set Up Next.js

- Install Next.js and set up your development environment.
- Configure Next.js to connect to your Laravel API by defining the API URL or base path.

Step 8: Design Frontend Components

- Plan and design the frontend components for your application using Next.js and React.
- Determine the pages, layouts, and reusable components needed to display the MLB The Show data.

Step 9: Connect to API from Next.js

- Use Next.js's data fetching methods (e.g., `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or `useEffect` with `fetch`) to connect to your Laravel API and retrieve the MLB The Show data.
- Test the API connections and ensure you're receiving the expected data.

Step 10: Build Frontend Views

- Implement the frontend views using the components designed in the previous step.
- Use the retrieved data from the API to populate the views and display the MLB The Show information.

Step 11: Implement Interactivity

- Add interactivity to your frontend views using React components and event handlers.
- Allow users to perform actions such as filtering players, searching for specific data, and navigating through different pages.

Step 12: Test and Debug

- Thoroughly test your application to ensure all features are working as expected.
- Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.

Step 13: Deploy

- Prepare your application for deployment to a production environment.
- Set up your server or hosting provider, configure the necessary environment variables, and deploy your Laravel API and Next.js frontend.

Step 14: Monitor and Maintain

- Monitor the performance and usage of your application in the production environment.
- Implement any necessary maintenance and updates to keep your application secure and up-to-date.

Remember to break down each step into smaller tasks and prioritize them based on dependencies and complexity. This plan should give you a general roadmap for building your application, but feel free to make adjustments as needed based on your specific requirements and circumstances.
